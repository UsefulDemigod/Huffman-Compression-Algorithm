# Huffman-Compression-Algorithm
Python implementation of Huffman compression, which is a well-known algorithm for lossless data compression. 
* Implementation covers the basic steps of building a Huffman tree, generating Huffman codes, compressing text, and decompressing text. Note that edge cases involving different characters, empty input, and rare scenarios have not been considered in the code.
